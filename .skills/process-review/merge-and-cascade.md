# Phase 6: Merge & Close — Detail

Disclosed from [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) Phase 6 — only reached when the reviewer picked "Merge now" in Step 5.5, and only executed when the PR state synthesis says `ready-to-merge` (Step 6.0).

### Step 6.0: Merge Precondition — PR state must be `ready-to-merge` (BLOCKING)

The merge is permitted by the **synthesis**, not by the reviewer's enthusiasm — see [pr-states.md](../../.pair/knowledge/guidelines/collaboration/project-management-tool/pr-states.md).

1. **Act**: Re-read the current signals (gates, verdict, `risk:*` tier, human approvals on the current head) and re-run the Step 5.4 synthesis — signals may have changed since the verdict was submitted (a new commit, a tier raise, a dismissed approval).
2. **Check**: `merge_allowed <state>` (from [`pr-state.sh`](../../.pair/knowledge/assets/pr-state.sh)).
3. **Verify**: State is `ready-to-merge` → continue to Step 6.1. Any other state → **HALT**, reporting the unmet condition (red gate, review not approved, or 🔴 without explicit human approval). Never bypass, dismiss, or re-run a required check to get a green merge button.

### Step 6.1: Read Merge Strategy

1. **Check**: Is merge strategy specified in [way-of-working.md](../../.pair/adoption/tech/way-of-working.md)?
2. **Skip**: If not specified, default to `squash`.
3. **Act**: Read the adopted merge strategy (`squash`, `merge`, or `rebase`).
4. **Verify**: Strategy determined.

### Step 6.2: Prepare Merge Commit

1. **Act**: Draft the merge commit message following the [commit template](../../.pair/knowledge/guidelines/collaboration/templates/commit-template.md) (resolve override-first — [template resolution](../../.pair/knowledge/guidelines/technical-standards/ai-development/skill-conventions/template-resolution.md)):

   ```text
   [#<story-id>] feat: <story description>

   - <summary of changes>
   - Tasks: T-1, T-2, ..., T-N

   Refs: #<story-id>
   ```

2. **Act** (BLOCKING): Present to reviewer for confirmation:

   > **Merge commit message:**
   >
   > ```text
   > [commit message]
   > ```
   >
   > Confirm or edit?

3. **Verify**: Reviewer confirms message.

### Step 6.3: Merge PR

The merge happens on the **code host**; the item writes in Step 6.4 happen on the **PM tool**. When `code-host` is absent (or names the PM tool) both are the same tool and the two steps are indistinguishable. See the [routing table](../../.pair/knowledge/guidelines/technical-standards/ai-development/skill-conventions/way-of-working-pm-resolution.md).

1. **Act**: Merge the PR on the code host using the adopted strategy (for GitHub, per [github-implementation.md](../../.pair/knowledge/guidelines/collaboration/project-management-tool/github-implementation.md)):
   - MCP-first: use `merge_pull_request` with `merge_method` and `commit_title` + `commit_message`.
   - CLI fallback: `gh pr merge <number> --squash --subject "<title>" --body "<body>"`.
2. **Verify**: PR merged and closed on the code host.

### Step 6.4: Update Story & Parent Cascade

1. **Act**: Close the user story issue on the **PM tool** (an item write — never the code host; resolve the item id from the PR's `Refs: <issue-id>` cross-link when the tools are split). GitHub example:
   - MCP: `issue_write` with `method = update`, `state = closed`, `state_reason = completed`.
   - CLI: `gh issue close <story-number> --reason completed`.
2. **Act**: Check parent epic — read sub-issues to determine if ALL stories are Done:
   - MCP: `issue_read` with `method = get_sub_issues` on the epic.
   - If all sub-issues closed → close the epic with `state_reason = completed`.
   - If not all closed → leave epic open.
3. **Act**: Check parent initiative — same cascade logic:
   - If all epics closed → close the initiative.
   - If not all closed → leave initiative open.
4. **Verify**: Story closed. Epic and initiative updated if applicable.

### Step 6.5: Branch Cleanup

1. **Act**: Delete the feature branch on the code host (remote):
   - CLI: `git push origin --delete <branch>`.
2. **Act**: Remove the story's checkpoint if one exists — `.pair/working/checkpoints/<story-id>.md` — so completed-story state does not linger as stale context (per the task-scoped cleanup rule; see `/capability-checkpoint`).
3. **Verify**: Feature branch deleted and story checkpoint removed (if any existed).

### Step 6.6: Post-Merge Manual Test Validation (Optional)

1. **Check**: Is `/capability-execute-manual-tests` installed? Does the project have a manual test suite (`qa/` directory)?
2. **Skip**: If skill not installed or no test suite found → skip. Log: "Manual test validation skipped — no suite or skill not installed."
3. **Act**: Compose `/capability-execute-manual-tests` with `$scope = all`, `$priority = P0` (blockers only for fast validation).
4. **Verify**: If PASS → note in review output. If FAIL → do NOT revert the merge. Instead:
   - Create a GitHub issue for each Critical/Major failure.
   - Append manual test results as addendum to the review report (PR comment).
   - Warn: "Post-merge manual tests found failures. Issues created."
