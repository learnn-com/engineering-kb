# Quality Model

The single source of default quality rules for this KB. `classify`, `assess-cost`, `assess-security`, `pair-process-review`, `setup-gates`, and `pair-process-bootstrap` all resolve their behavior from this one document — no criteria live anywhere else. Project deviations are a delta in `tech/risk-matrix.md` (§6); absent, KB defaults apply completely.

**Resolution order** for every rule below: **Argument > Adoption > KB default**. Argument = an explicit override passed to a skill invocation by a human. Adoption = `tech/risk-matrix.md` (§6). KB default = this document. A malformed adoption file is treated as absent: skills warn and fall back to KB defaults.

## 1. Three-Layer Principle

| Layer | Role | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Doc** | Rules, written once, human-readable | this document + pillar guidelines (§7) |
| **Skill** | Applies the rules on demand, produces artifacts | `classify`, `assess-cost`, `assess-security`, `pair-process-review` |
| **Automation** | Consumes artifacts deterministically, zero judgment | CI gates, `pair-next --filter` |

**Shift-left** (R1.3): quality is classified in refinement — before code exists — not only at review time (see [Shift-Left Quality](README.md) in the QA framework overview). The matrix is built twice, refinement and review (§3.2); automation never adds its own criteria (D18) — it only reads tags.

## 2. Three Pillars

| Pillar | Covers | Tag family (if exposed) | Primary skill |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cost** | Financial exposure of building/running the change | `cost:*` — opt-in, §5 | `assess-cost` (cost-signal catalog) |
| **Security** | Vulnerabilities, compliance, secure-by-design | none dedicated — feeds `risk:*` (§3) + deterministic CI scanning | `assess-security`, [security/](security/README.md) |
| **Delivery** | Everything else: correctness, performance, a11y, observability, docs, planning, architecture, release, AI metrics | `risk:*` (correctness/blast-radius facets) — KB default, §5 | `pair-process-review`, `classify` |

Every theme not directly named here nests under one of these three — see §7. No status pages, no dedicated backlog per theme: a theme gets a card only when there is real work.

The **Security** pillar's rules resolve through their own 5-layer cascade (global KB → per-service → per-web-app → adoption project rules → package-scoped) — see `assess-security`'s Step 1, not duplicated here.

## 3. Classification Model

### 3.1 Risk dimensions

The compiled matrix has one row per dimension below. Each row resolves to `green`/`yellow`/`red`.

| Dimension | Req. | Source (refinement → review) | green | yellow | red |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Service/domain criticality | R5.1 | `tech/risk-matrix.md` criticality table | Low | Medium (default when the file is absent) | High (default for a service/domain **not listed** in an existing table — conservative) |
| Change/diff risk | R5.2 | story scope → diff footprint | isolated, localized change | touches multiple modules or shared code | schema/migration, contract-breaking change, or infra provisioning change |
| Business impact | R4.3 | subdomain classification of what the story/diff touches | `generic` subdomain | `supporting` subdomain | `core` subdomain |
| Security relevance | — | heuristic over touched paths | no security-sensitive surface | security-adjacent (new external dependency, input validation on a non-critical path) | authn/authz, secrets/credentials, cryptography, PII, untrusted-input parsing |
| Coupling balance | — | story context (touched subdomains' volatility + cross-context integrations) → diff (`assess-coupling` verdict) | balanced | unbalanced + stable | unbalanced + volatile |

Coupling sources absent (no subdomain/bounded-context artifacts, no `assess-coupling` available) ⇒ reported **not assessed**, excluded from the max below, never blocks (D21). See `architecture/design-patterns/coupling-balance.md` (nested taxonomy entry, §7, not yet published) — the single home for the coupling model itself; this document never duplicates that content, only the classification rule above.

### 3.2 Tier resolution

**Risk tier = max(assessed dimensions above)**, projected as `risk:green|yellow|red`.

- Built **twice** per story (D17): in refinement from the **story context** (declared/estimated), in review from the **code/diff** (observed). The review value is a floor: it may raise the tier, **never lower it**.
- A PR with no classification present is treated as `red` (fail-safe).
- Cost (§3.3) is not part of this max — it is its own class, computed independently and carried in the same compiled matrix; it gets its own tag format, `cost:green|yellow|orange|red`, only if a project chooses to expose it as a tag (§5) — it is never a KB default.

### 3.3 Cost class (R6.2)

Cost class = **highest detected signal**. The signal catalog (paid-SDK imports, API-key env vars, IaC/provisioning changes, cron/queues, media processing, LLM calls) is maintained in the [cost-assessment guideline](cost-assessment.md), applied by `assess-cost`; no signal detected ⇒ `green`. General + provider-specific heuristics (AWS first, other providers via adoption links) live there too; deeper running-cost optimization is in [infrastructure/cloud-providers/cost-optimization.md](../infrastructure/cloud-providers/cost-optimization.md). This value is always computed and written to the story/PR body's matrix (§1); it is projected as the `cost:green|yellow|orange|red` tag only if a project adds `cost` to its Tag Projection declaration (§5) — the KB does not do this by default.

**Cost monitoring (R6.3/R6.4) → `assess-cost` report mode.** The class above is computed twice per change (refinement, review); comparing the refinement-time *prediction* against the *real* class of the merged diff (R6.3) and surfacing systematic drift **periodically rather than per-PR** (R6.4) is `assess-cost`'s report mode, rendered as a period-keyed panel per the [report-panel convention](../collaboration/working-area.md#report-panels--period-key-and-idempotent-update). Drift is measured against the catalog current at run time — a catalog change inside the monitored window is a confounder, not a prediction error.

## 4. Per-Tier Requirements

| Tier | Merge | Reviewers | SLA | Checklist | Approval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 🟢 Green | Self-merge once gate checks are green | 0 (AI review informational, ≤4h) | — | standard | none |
| 🟡 Yellow | Blocked until reviewed | 1 reviewer | 1 working day | standard | reviewer approval |
| 🔴 Red | Blocked until reviewed and approved | 1 reviewer | 2 working days | extended | explicit approval required |

**Checklist depth** is that table's third column and means exactly this — there is no separate "extended checklist" artifact anywhere, and none is needed:

| Depth | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `standard` (🟢/🟡) | The [code-review template](../collaboration/templates/code-review-template.md) — resolved per [template resolution](../technical-standards/ai-development/skill-conventions/template-resolution.md) — as designed: verdict first, the Assessments block, and the Details sections that the change actually touches. Sections with nothing to say are collapsed/omitted. |
| `extended` (🔴) | The **same** template with **no section skipped**: every Assessments subsection (all Security dimensions, Cost, Architecture) and every Details section is answered explicitly — "not applicable" is written out rather than omitted — and the Definition-of-Done check is run in full. Depth, not a different document. |

Reviewer counts and SLAs are **KB defaults** (D10), resolved through the same **Argument > Adoption > KB default** cascade as every other rule in this document — not fixed forever. A project may override either per tier in `tech/risk-matrix.md`'s Overrides section (§6), e.g. requiring 2 reviewers at 🔴 Red for a larger team:

```markdown
## Overrides

- tier.red.reviewers: 2
- tier.red.sla_days: 3
```

Review always runs and tests are always green, at every tier (R5.3 + D10) — **that** part is not overridable. Everything else in the table above is: the reviewer count, the SLA, the checklist depth and whether 🔴 requires explicit approval are read through the `Argument > Adoption > KB default` cascade, so a project redefines them in its own `way-of-working.md`.

**And whether any of it BLOCKS is opt-in.** The table states requirements; making them enforceable is the `Review enforcement` flag in `way-of-working.md`, **`disabled` by default**. Disabled, the review still runs and publishes its verdict, `pr-state:*` is still synthesized, and nothing is a required check — the verdict is information, not a gate. Enabled, `pair-review` and `pair-explicit-approval` become required and the 🔴 rule binds. The default is deliberate: a review that blocks on a fresh install produces a repository nobody can merge into, and on a single-maintainer repo the 🔴 non-author approval cannot be obtained at all. `/pair-process-bootstrap` asks for the flag when no decision exists rather than assuming one. Gate (mechanical) and review (judgment) are distinct enforcers — gate blocks first, review starts only once gates are green. **Refinement** (the merge-side companion below, [pr-states.md](../collaboration/project-management-tool/pr-states.md)): a review *may* run at a red gate to report findings early, but it produces **no merge-enabling verdict** — a red gate never yields `ready-to-merge`, whatever the judgment says. "Starts only once gates are green" is about the *merge-enabling* review, not about a prohibition on reading a red-gated diff.

| Tier | Gate checks |
| --- | --- |
| 🟢 | lint + type + build |
| 🟡 | + unit |
| 🔴 | + integration/E2E |

Install runs at every tier (implicit in each row). Deterministic secret scanning also runs at **every** tier, unconditionally — it is not tier-scoped (security/[secret-scanning.md](security/secret-scanning.md)). How this matrix becomes an actual pipeline that reads the `risk:*` tag only (fail-safe 🔴 when untagged, explicit failure on a missing suite, build+deploy-only post-merge staging) is the delivery-side companion [tier-aware-pipeline.md](../infrastructure/cicd-strategy/tier-aware-pipeline.md) — this table stays the single source of the criteria; that document owns the wiring.

How the two enforcers combine into a merge decision — the PR states (`to-be-reviewed` → `ready-to-merge` / `not-approved`), the synthesis of gates × verdict × tier × explicit approval, and the required checks that make the review unskippable — is the review-side companion [pr-states.md](../collaboration/project-management-tool/pr-states.md). It **reads** the requirements above (including the 🔴 explicit-approval row) and declares none of its own.

## 5. Tag Projection

Chromatic, no semantic tag beyond color. **`risk:green|yellow|red` (§3.2) is the only tag family the KB names and proposes by default.**

**Tag emission is declared, not implicit.** `classify` only creates tags once a `## Tag Projection` declaration exists in `tech/risk-matrix.md` (§6) — but that declaration is not something a project has to remember to write from scratch:

- **Only `risk` is a KB default.** Every other parameter this model computes — cost class (§3.3), security relevance, business impact, coupling balance, or any dimension added later — is available to expose as its own tag, but the KB does not pre-select which, if any: that choice belongs entirely to the project. Adding a parameter to the declaration (e.g. `Active: risk, cost`) is what exposes it; nothing beyond `risk` is projected until a project explicitly says so.
- **`classify` proposes only the `risk` default on its own first run**, the same propose-then-write-if-confirmed pattern already used elsewhere in this KB (e.g. `pair-capability-verify-quality`'s first-time Custom Gate Registry setup):
  1. **Check**: does `tech/risk-matrix.md` have a `## Tag Projection` section?
  2. **Skip**: if yes, use it exactly as written — including an explicit opt-out (see below) — and never propose again.
  3. **Act**: if no, ask before creating any tag:

     > No Tag Projection declared yet. Activate `risk:green|yellow|red` on stories and PRs? (recommended — other model parameters can be exposed as tags later, if you decide you want them)
     > 1. Yes, activate `risk` (writes the declaration below)
     > 2. No, don't tag anything (records the opt-out so this isn't asked again)

  4. **Verify**: the compiled matrix is written to the story/PR body **regardless of the answer** — §3.2/§3.3's body output never depends on tag projection; only tag *emission* is gated by it.
- Until the proposal is answered, or if it's explicitly declined, the matrix still exists in the story/PR body — it is simply not projected onto tags.

```markdown
## Tag Projection

Active: risk
```

A project decides which other model parameters, if any, to expose by adding them to the `Active` list — e.g. `Active: risk, cost` if it also wants the cost class (§3.3) projected as a tag; the choice, and the resulting tag's color scheme, follows whichever parameter was added. Write `Active: none` to explicitly opt out of all tag emission (`classify` reads this as a durable "don't ask again," not as "not yet configured"). A project may also rename `risk` itself here (e.g. `risk` → `priority`) — the color values and their meaning stay the same, only the label changes.

**No dedicated eligibility tag**: automation eligibility is an **adoption-declared filter over classification tags** (e.g. `risk:green`, optionally combined with project tags), not a special tag of its own. `pair-next` consumes it generically, like any other tag filter, re-evaluated on every run (tags can change between runs, e.g. review raising the tier).

## 6. `tech/risk-matrix.md` — Adoption Delta

Optional file holding up to three independent sections — a project may have none, one, or all three; the presence of one never implies the others:

- **`## Tag Projection`** (§5) — which classification tags get emitted. In practice the section most projects end up with first, since `classify` proactively proposes it the first time it runs (§5) — a project doesn't have to know this file exists to get a sensible default.
- **`## Criticality Table`** — per-service/domain criticality overrides (§3.1).
- **`## Overrides`** — threshold overrides for other dimensions, plus optional per-tier reviewer-count/SLA overrides (§4).

Absent entirely ⇒ KB defaults (§3.1) apply completely to the matrix, and no tags are emitted (§5) — nothing fails (D21). This is the state before `classify` has ever run, or before its Tag Projection proposal has been answered.

```markdown
## Tag Projection

Active: risk

## Criticality Table

| Service/Domain | Criticality |
| --- | --- |
| payments | High |
| marketing-site | Low |

## Overrides

- change-risk.shared-paths: ["packages/billing/**"]
```

- **Malformed file** (unparseable table, unknown keys): skills warn and fall back to KB defaults entirely (D21) — including no tag emission, exactly as if the whole file were absent.
- **Unknown service/domain** (queried but not in the criticality table): treated as unclassified ⇒ conservative High for that dimension.
- A filled-in example (also usable as adoption starting point) is at [risk-matrix-example.md](../../assets/risk-matrix-example.md).

### Resolution-cascade walkthrough

| Scenario | `tech/risk-matrix.md` | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No file, or Tag Projection proposal not yet answered | absent, or missing `## Tag Projection` | Matrix computed and written to the story/PR body per §3.1 defaults; no tags emitted — `classify` proposes the Tag Projection declaration on its next run |
| Tag Projection declared, `risk` active | `## Tag Projection` → `Active: risk` | `risk:*` tag applied to the story/PR alongside the body matrix; `classify` never re-proposes |
| Tag Projection explicitly opted out | `## Tag Projection` → `Active: none` | Matrix written to the body; no tags applied; `classify` never re-proposes |
| File present, service listed | `payments: High` | `payments` resolves to red for that dimension, overriding the Medium default (AC3) |
| File present, service **not** listed | table has other entries only | Conservative High (red) for that dimension, not the absent-file Medium default |
| File present but malformed | unparseable | Warn, fall back to KB defaults as if absent (including no tag emission) |
